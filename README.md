# Visualization of COVID-19 Cases in the US Over 1-year Span 

In this project, we present an analysis of data surrounding COVID-19 in the US over the year 2020. We present several visualizations that display trends in the spread
of COVID-19 across the country throughout 2020 on a state and county level. 

To view all visualizations, simply clone this repository and run the sl.py Python file, which will then display all visualizations in Streamlit.
